# Inception_V3_Distinguish_Pneumonia_RohitKumar
Assignment: Fine-tune a Inception-V3 to distinguish pneumonia from normal chest X-ray, and report your modelâ€™s performance.

# Pneumonia Classification with InceptionV3 (Transfer Learning)
This project uses a transfer learning approach with InceptionV3 to classify chest X-ray images from the PneumoniaMNIST dataset (from MedMNIST).

#Features
- Transfer learning using pre-trained InceptionV3 (ImageNet)
- Data augmentation and class balancing
- Custom F1-Score metric
- Early stopping and model checkpointing
- Reproducible training pipeline

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hope1ess/Inception_V3_Distinguish_Pneumonia_RohitKumar.git
